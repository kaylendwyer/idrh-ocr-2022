# Setting things up

## Workshop setup
Students do not need to install anything to their own systems. 

However, if you are not from KU, you will need one of the following:
- Shibboleth
- InCommon institutional login
- GitHub account
- ORCID account

This workshop uses an image in Jupyter Hub, allowing each student to run tesseract in the command line without installation. Our goal is to offer an introduction to OCR and Tesseract without additional tools mediating or confusing that process.

## Working at home
If you would like to use tesseract on your own machine, follow the [installation guidelines in the tesseract documentation.](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/#compiling-and-installation)

The OCR lessons use images in a [zipped file on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaylendwyer/idrh-ocr-2022/blob/main/OCR-images.zip).
